      <h2>World hunger</h2>
        <p>
          The number of people suffering from hunger is once again on the raise. Since 2015 a slow increase was measured all around the world and today around 690 million people are going hungry which accounts for 8.9 % of the total world population.
          People that experience food insecurity are unable to eat a healthy, balanced diet on a regular basis.
          <br><br>
          If the recent trend continues the world will not reach its goal reaching Zero Hunger by 2030.
          The current trend indicates that by then end of this decade more the number of people suffering from acute hunger will increase to more than 840 million (UN, 2021).
          The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations predicts that by 2030 the prevalence of undernourishment will increase to levels not seen since 2010 when 9.6 % of the world population was undernourished.
          The biggest increases in undernourishment and hunger are predicted to be in the middle and eastern Africa <a href ="https://www.fao.org/3/ca9692en/ca9692en.pdf">(FAO, IFDA, UNICEF et al., 2020)</a>.

        <h2>Causes for world hunger</h2>
        <p>
          The causes for world hunger are climate shocks, lotus crisis and armed conflicts. 
          The current pandemic represents an additional threat to the food system as it causes delays in the food supply chain.<br><br>
          One of the causes is declining food production connected with the civil insecurity. In developing countries 40% â€“ 85% of all food produces comes from small scale farmers. 
          If the farmers are hit by natural disasters or displaced by conflict the food production declines as a result, leading to food scarcity and high prices <a href = "https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/">(UN, 2021)</a>.
